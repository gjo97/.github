PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) is an open-source battery simulation package
written in Python. Our mission is to accelerate battery modelling research by
providing open-source tools for multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration.
Broadly, PyBaMM consists of
(i) a framework for writing and solving systems
of differential equations,
(ii) a library of battery models and parameters, and
(iii) specialized tools for simulating battery-specific experiments and visualizing the results.
Together, these enable flexible model definitions and fast battery simulations, allowing users to
explore the effect of different battery designs and modeling assumptions under a variety of operating scenarios.
